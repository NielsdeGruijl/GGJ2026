Enemy and player level up systems
- Enemies give player XP on death
- Enemies level up every interval (maybe not base enemies tho)


- Combat juice:
	- Add enemy knockback on hit X
	- Check damage flash shader performance X
	- Improve damage popup performance



- Come up with better bogged lingering area solution
	- currently uses exact same prefab - same debuff data
	- can't change data (damage) independently
